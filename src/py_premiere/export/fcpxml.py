"""FCPXML export.

FCPXML is the cheapest interchange format to reach - plain XML against a
published DTD, where AAF is an OLE compound file and OMF a binary
interchange.

**Premiere cannot read what this writes.** It was picked first on the
belief that it round-tripped, and it does not: Premiere reads Final Cut
Pro **7** XML (`<xmeml>`, `.xml`), while this emits Final Cut Pro **X**'s
FCPXML (`<fcpxml>`), which Resolve and FCP X read. Handed a `.fcpxml`,
Premiere 26.3 answers "File format not supported" - a hand-written
minimal document included, so it is the format being refused and not
anything written here. Treat this as a one-way export to Resolve/FCP X.

Times are rationals in seconds (`N/Ds`). Premiere's tick is 1/254016000000
of a second, so every tick count converts exactly with no rounding; the
fractions are reduced only for readability.

Structure written per sequence:

    resources   one `format` for the sequence, one `asset` per media file
    spine       the first video track, with `gap` elements over the holes
    lanes       every other track's clips, as connected clips on the spine

A connected clip hangs off the spine element covering its start, with its
offset expressed in that parent's timeline, which is what the format
requires - lanes count up for video and down for audio.
